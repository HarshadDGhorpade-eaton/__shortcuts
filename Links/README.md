Links :
The shortcut links are created here for quick access of frequently needed webpages using Keyperinhia tool.

The biggest advantage using this is that you can open any links from while working on any other stuff.

Keyperinhia tool is smart enough to track down the frequency of accessing a file and add it to its database and next time you try to access the same link you can see that entry.

Example : first time you try to access link named "Joe Home.url", you need to give absolute path to the file

Next time you try to access same link just open Keyperinhia and just start typing "Joe Home..." you will see recently accessed file with same name and lists it.
